Current Long Term Memory: User greeted with "hey"; AI responded by noting it wasn't a question and offered assistance or to chat. User then asked for "help me black hooles"; AI explained what black holes are and offered to discuss their formation, different types, event horizon, what happens if one falls in, or Hawking radiation. User then requested "do depth research"; AI responded by explaining the formation of stellar black holes (from collapsed massive stars if the core is >3 solar masses) and supermassive black holes (theories include direct gas collapse or mergers of massive stars/smaller black holes). AI then offered further topics: Event Horizon/spaghettification, Hawking Radiation, different black hole classifications, or Gravitational Waves. AI then chose to elaborate on the Event Horizon and spaghettification, explaining it as the point of no return where intense tidal forces stretch and tear apart objects due to extreme gravity.
